The integration of the U.S. National Grid (USNG) coordinates in online web mapping systems has only been partially implemented on a variety of web mapping pages. When not in possession of USNG standardized printed map products, one of the most difficult things to do is to take a USNG coordinate and quickly produce a basic, readable map, or visa versa: take a basic map or address and obtain a USNG coordinate.

To relieve this difficulty, Larry Moore developed a web map based on the Google Maps API that incorporated USNG coordinates (http://dhost.info/usngweb/). This project attempts to update that code to version 3 of the Google Maps API, incorporating Javascript libraries from Jim Klassen (https://github.com/klassenjs/usng_tools) and Xavier Irias (http://www.ersquared.org/).

THIS CODE IS CURRENTLY IN BETA.
